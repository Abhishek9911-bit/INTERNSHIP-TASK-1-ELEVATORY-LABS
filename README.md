# Internship Task 1 – Local Network Port Scanning

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to perform a **network reconnaissance scan** on a local subnet to identify **open, closed, and filtered TCP ports** on devices. This helps in understanding network exposure and potential security risks.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Nmap (Network Mapper):** For scanning devices and detecting open/closed ports.
* **Wireshark (optional):** For packet capturing and deeper traffic analysis (not performed in this task).

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. Identified the local subnet IP range: `192.168.12.0/24`.
2. Executed a **TCP SYN scan** using:

   ```bash
   nmap -sS 192.168.12.0/24
   ```

   *(Alternative example used for top 20 ports:)*

   ```bash
   nmap -sS -Pn --top-ports 20 -T4 -oN nmap_scan.txt 10.0.8.0/21
   ```
3. Noted the status of scanned ports (open/closed/filtered) for each host.
4. Saved raw scan outputs (text/screenshots) for documentation.
5. Analyzed results to identify active services and evaluate security posture.

## 📊 Findings

### 🔹 Host: **192.168.12.139 (Apple)**

* All ports appeared **filtered**: rsftp (26), hosts2-ns (81), smtps (465), postgresql (5432), X11 (6001), etc.
* Strong firewall settings / active filtering detected.

### 🔹 Host: **192.168.12.1 (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)**

* Open ports:

  * **22 (SSH):** Secure remote access.
  * **23 (Telnet):** Insecure remote sessions, should be disabled.
  * **80 (HTTP):** Web server/device management.
* ⚠️ Security Risk: Telnet service active.

### 🔹 Host: **192.168.12.52 (Unknown Vendor)**

* Major ports (22, 23, 25, 80, 443, 3306, 3389) found **closed**.
* Indicates minimal exposure or inactive system.

---

## 🔐 Security Insights

* Most devices had **closed/filtered ports**, indicating strong protection.
* Devices with **open ports** must be monitored for vulnerabilities.
* Telnet should be **disabled**, SSH preferred for secure access.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

* Perform **regular port scans** to detect newly exposed services.
* Disable **legacy protocols** like Telnet.
* Ensure **firewall rules** actively block unwanted traffic.
* Secure open services (e.g., SSH, HTTP) with strong authentication and updates.

---

## 📝 Conclusion

The network scan revealed that most hosts are secure with closed or filtered ports. A few devices expose services (SSH/HTTP), and one device has Telnet enabled, which should be addressed.
This exercise highlighted the importance of **port scanning, service identification, and reducing attack surfaces** in cybersecurity.

Do you want me to **add diagrams** (like a port scan workflow or open vs closed ports) to the README.md for better visualization?
