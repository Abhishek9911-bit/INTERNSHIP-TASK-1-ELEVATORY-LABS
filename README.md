# INTERNSHIP-TASK-1-ELEVATE-LABS
: Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand  network exposure. 

INTERNSHIP TASK 1 â€“ LOCAL NETWORK PORT SCANNING

Objective
The objective of this task is to perform a network reconnaissance scan on a local subnet to identify open, closed, and filtered TCP ports on devices. This helps in understanding network exposure and potential security risks.

Tools Used

* Nmap (Network Mapper): For scanning devices and detecting open/closed ports.
* Wireshark (optional): For packet capturing and deeper traffic analysis (not performed in this task).

Methodology

1. Identified the local subnet IP range: 192.168.12.0/24.
2. Executed a TCP SYN scan using:
   nmap -sS 192.168.12.0/24
   (Alternative example for top 20 ports:)
   nmap -sS -Pn --top-ports 20 -T4 -oN nmap\_scan.txt 10.0.8.0/21
3. Noted the status of scanned ports (open/closed/filtered) for each host.
4. Saved raw scan outputs (text/screenshots) for documentation.
5. Analyzed results to identify active services and evaluate security posture.

Findings

Host: 192.168.12.139 (Apple)

* All ports appeared filtered: rsftp (26), hosts2-ns (81), smtps (465), postgresql (5432), X11 (6001), etc.
* Strong firewall settings or active filtering detected.

Host: 192.168.12.1 (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)

* Open ports:
  22 (SSH): Secure remote access.
  23 (Telnet): Insecure remote sessions, should be disabled.
  80 (HTTP): Web server/device management.
* Security Risk: Telnet service active.

Host: 192.168.12.52 (Unknown Vendor)

* Major ports (22, 23, 25, 80, 443, 3306, 3389) found closed.
* Indicates minimal exposure or inactive system.

Security Insights

* Most devices had closed or filtered ports, indicating strong protection.
* Devices with open ports must be monitored for vulnerabilities.
* Telnet should be disabled, SSH preferred for secure access.

Recommendations

* Perform regular port scans to detect newly exposed services.
* Disable legacy protocols like Telnet.
* Ensure firewall rules actively block unwanted traffic.
* Secure open services (e.g., SSH, HTTP) with strong authentication and updates.

Conclusion
The network scan revealed that most hosts are secure with closed or filtered ports. A few devices expose services (SSH/HTTP), and one device has Telnet enabled, which should be addressed. This exercise highlighted the importance of port scanning, service identification, and reducing attack surfaces in cybersecurity.
